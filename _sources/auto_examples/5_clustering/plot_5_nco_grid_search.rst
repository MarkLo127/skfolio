=============================
NCO - Combinatorial Purged CV
=============================

The previous tutorial introduced the
:class:`~skfolio.optimization.NestedClustersOptimization`.

In this tutorial, we will perform hyperparameter search using `GridSearch` and
distribution analysis with `CombinatorialPurgedCV`.

Data
====
We load the S&P 500 :ref:`dataset <datasets>` composed of the daily prices of 20
assets from the S&P 500 Index composition starting from 2015-01-02 up to 2022-12-28:

Model
=====
We create two models: the NCO and the equal-weighted benchmark:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 48-54

.. code-block:: Python

    benchmark = EqualWeighted()

    model_nco = NestedClustersOptimization(
        inner_estimator=MeanRisk(), clustering_estimator=HierarchicalClustering()
    )

Parameter Tuning
================
We find the model parameters that maximizes the out-of-sample Sharpe ratio using
`GridSearchCV` with `WalkForward` cross-validation on the training set.
The `WalkForward` are chosen to simulate a three months (60 business days) rolling
portfolio fitted on the previous year (252 business days):

Prediction
==========
We evaluate the two models using the same `WalkForward` object on the test set:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 88-102

.. code-block:: Python

    pred_bench = cross_val_predict(
        benchmark,
        X_test,
        cv=cv,
        portfolio_params=dict(name="Benchmark"),
    )

    pred_nco = cross_val_predict(
        model_nco,
        X_test,
        cv=cv,
        n_jobs=-1,
        portfolio_params=dict(name="NCO"),
    )







.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 103-105

Each predicted object is a `MultiPeriodPortfolio`.
For improved analysis, we can add them to a `Population`:

.. GENERATED FROM PYTHON SOURCE LINES 105-107

.. code-block:: Python

    population = Population([pred_bench, pred_nco])

Combinatorial Purged Cross-Validation
=====================================
Only using one testing path (the historical path) may not be enough for comparing both
models. For a more robust analysis, we can use
:class:`~skfolio.model_selection.CombinatorialPurgedCV` to create multiple testing
paths from different training folds combinations.

Conclusion
==========
This NCO model outperforms the Benchmark in terms of Sharpe Ratio on the historical
test set. However, the distribution analysis on the recombined (non-historical) test
sets shows that it slightly underperforms the Benchmark in average.

This was a toy example to present the API. Further analysis using different
estimators, datasets and CV parameters should be performed to determine if the
outperformance on the historical test set is due to chance or if this NCO model is
able to exploit time-dependencies information lost in `CombinatorialPurgedCV`.
